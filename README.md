# SY19_Projet2

This project is part of the course SY19 - Machine Learning, with 3 members. <br>

It consists in analyzing 3 real world datasets in **R**. The subject can be found at `sy19_a21_tp10.pdf`. <br> 

There is one branch for each dataset while the `main` branch is only used for the report. I was in charge of the dataset **phonemes**. You can find the report at `Rapport.pdf`.
